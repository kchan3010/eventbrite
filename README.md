# eventbrite

The two scripts that you will want to run are ratings.php and calendar.php.  Both scripts can either take the input files as
arguments or STDIN.

The ratings.php will expect to use the "2_ratings.txt" file

The calendar php will expect to files: "1_caldendar.txt" and the "proposed_times.txt".  Per the instructions that this script
will take in two lists, I separated the booked calendar events from the proposed times.
